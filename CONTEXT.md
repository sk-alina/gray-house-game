- Easter egg: Konami code activation

### Game Modes
1. **Simple Hallway Game**: 2D corridor exploration with interactive doors
2. **Enhanced Floor Explorer**: Multi-floor navigation with detailed room mapping

### Technical Implementation
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5 Canvas for game rendering
- CSS3 animations and transitions
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessibility considerations

## Character Profiles
- **Sphinx**: Protagonist with no arms, navigating school hierarchy
- **Noble**: Golden-haired leader with complex personality
- **Tabaqui**: Wheelchair user with philosophical outlook

- **Jackal**: Group storyteller and commentator

## Game Mechanics
- Player movement with arrow keys/WASD
- Interactive area detection and highlighting
- Floor switching system (6 floors total)
- Room identification and interaction prompts
- Visual feedback for player actions

## Floor Layout System
- **Third Floor (fl1)**: Library, Buffet, Attic, Corridors
- **Second Floor (fl2)**: Dormitories, Classrooms, Dining Hall
- **First Floor (fl3)**: Gym, Pool, Auditorium, Courtyard, Sepulcher entrance
- **Basement (fl4)**: Medical facilities, Storage areas

## Context for Future Development
This project represents a complete web-based game prototype with both presentation (landing page) and interactive (playable games) components. The codebase is well-structured for expansion, with clear separation between UI, game logic, and visual rendering. The enhanced game mode provides a solid foundation for developing a full adventure game with room-by-room exploration, character interactions, and narrative progression.

The project successfully captures the atmospheric and mysterious tone of the source material while providing an engaging interactive experience. All code is documented and follows modern web development best practices.
